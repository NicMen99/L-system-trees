# L-system-trees

Small project work to model trees using L-system and OpenGL.

Most of the code to work with OpenGL was created with the help of the tutorials found on the [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) website.

External libraries are included under the `/lib` folder and are already linked in `CMakeList.txt`.
